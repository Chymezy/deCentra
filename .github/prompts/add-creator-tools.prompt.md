## Backend Tasks (Rust + ic-cdk)

### 1. Micro-Tipping System
- Add `ContentTip` struct with tip amount, sender, recipient, content reference
- Implement `tip_content()` endpoint with ICP transfer integration
- Add tip history tracking and aggregation
- Include spam prevention (rate limiting, minimum amounts)

### 2. Creator Subscriptions  
- Add `CreatorSubscription` with tiers (Basic/Premium), pricing, benefits
- Implement subscription lifecycle management (subscribe/cancel/renew)
- Add subscriber access control for premium content
- Include automatic payment processing

### 3. Creator Analytics
- Add `CreatorAnalytics` with engagement metrics, revenue tracking, audience insights
- Implement analytics calculation engine for real-time stats
- Add revenue reporting (tips, subscriptions, total earnings)
- Include audience demographics and growth metrics

## Frontend Tasks (React + TypeScript)

### 1. Creator Dashboard
- Build comprehensive analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- Add revenue tracking with ICP conversion rates
- Implement subscriber management interface
- Include content performance analytics

### 2. Monetization UI
- Add tip buttons to posts with amount selection
- Build subscription management for creators and users
- Implement payment confirmation flows
- Add creator payout request interface

### 3. Analytics Components
- Create revenue charts (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Build engagement metric visualizations
- Add subscriber growth tracking
- Implement export functionality for tax reporting

## Code Patterns

Backend endpoint example:
```rust
#[ic_cdk::update]
pub async fn tip_content(content_id: PostId, amount: u64) -> Result<TipId, String>
```

Frontend component example:
```typescript
export function TipButton({ postId, creatorId }: TipButtonProps)
export function CreatorDashboard({ creatorId }: CreatorDashboardProps)
```
