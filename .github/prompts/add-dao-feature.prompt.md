# DAO Governance Implementation

Implement community-driven governance system with proposal voting, treasury management, and democratic decision-making.

## Backend Tasks (Rust + ic-cdk)

### 1. Governance Token System
- Add `GovernanceToken` with voting power calculation
- Implement token distribution (staking rewards, participation rewards)
- Add token delegation for proxy voting
- Include token lock-up periods for serious proposals

### 2. Proposal Management
- Add `Proposal` struct with type (policy, feature, treasury), description, voting deadline
- Implement proposal lifecycle (draft → active → executed/rejected)
- Add proposal requirements (minimum token threshold, endorsements)
- Include emergency proposal fast-tracking

### 3. Voting System
- Add `Vote` tracking with weighted voting based on token holdings
- Implement various voting mechanisms (simple majority, supermajority, quadratic)
- Add vote delegation and proxy voting
- Include vote privacy options and verification

### 4. Treasury Management
- Add `Treasury` with multi-sig functionality for fund management
- Implement budget allocation and spending proposals
- Add treasury reporting and transparency features
- Include emergency fund access controls

## Frontend Tasks (React + TypeScript)

### 1. Governance Dashboard
- Build proposal browsing with filtering and search
- Add voting interface with clear options and deadlines
- Implement proposal creation wizard for community members
- Include governance statistics and participation metrics

### 2. Token Management
- Create token balance and voting power display
- Build delegation interface for proxy voting
- Add staking interface for governance participation
- Implement token earning tracking

### 3. Treasury Interface
- Build treasury overview with fund allocation charts
- Add spending proposal tracking and transparency
- Implement budget visualization and reporting
- Include community fund request interface

## Code Patterns

Backend proposal example:
```rust
#[ic_cdk::update]
pub async fn create_proposal(proposal_type: ProposalType, description: String) -> Result<ProposalId, String>

#[ic_cdk::update]
pub async fn vote_on_proposal(proposal_id: ProposalId, vote: VoteOption) -> Result<(), String>
```

Frontend component example:
```typescript
export function ProposalCard({ proposal }: ProposalCardProps)
export function VotingInterface({ proposalId }: VotingInterfaceProps)
export function GovernanceDashboard()
```

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Token distribution fair and transparent
- [ ] Voting system secure against manipulation
- [ ] Proposal process clear and accessible
- [ ] Treasury management transparent
- [ ] UI intuitive for governance participation
