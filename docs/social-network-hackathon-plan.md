# Fully On-Chain Social Network – WCHL 2025 Hackathon Plan

## Project Overview
A decentralized social network built entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). All user data, posts, likes, and follows are stored and managed on-chain, ensuring censorship resistance, user ownership, and full transparency. The project will be open source and deployed to the ICP mainnet.

---

## 1. The Problem: A Broken Global Social Media Landscape
- **Censorship & Sanctions Are Rising:**
  - TikTok banned on government devices in US, UK, India, EU; India banned TikTok for all users in 2020 (~200M users lost overnight).
  - Meta (Facebook, Instagram) fined billions in Europe under GDPR for data misuse.
  - Google fined €2.4B by EU for anti-competitive practices.
  - Twitter restricted/banned in Russia, Turkey, Nigeria during political unrest.
  - In 2023, over 45 countries imposed internet censorship laws.
- **Global Trend:** Governments are asserting control over data and content. Social platforms become weapons or targets.

## 2. The Solution: Fully On-Chain Social
A censorship-resistant, privacy-focused social network 100% on ICP.
- No centralized servers to sanction or seize.
- Anonymous whistleblower tools for activists.
- DAO moderation — community, not governments, decides.
- Creator monetization without intermediaries.
- Blueprint for a free, global internet.

## 3. Business Model: Sustainable Monetization
| Revenue Stream         | How It Works                                                      | Target Users                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 🪙 Micro-Tipping      | Users send ICP tokens to creators for posts (“likes with value”).  | All users                   |
| 🏪 Creator Marketplace| Sell premium content, NFTs, courses directly on-chain.             | Influencers, artists        |
| 📣 DAO-Approved Ads   | Businesses pay ICP to promote content; users vote on ads.          | NGOs, ethical brands        |
| 💼 Enterprise Tools   | Paid dashboards for NGOs/journalists: analytics, encrypted reports.| NGOs, agencies              |
| 🌱 Partnership Grants | Collaborate with Human Rights Orgs, UN agencies for funding.       | Foundations                 |

## 4. Market Opportunity
| Market Segment                  | Value                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 🌏 Censored Regions Users       | 3.3 Billion people           |
| 🎥 Global Creator Economy       | $104 Billion (2024)          |
| 📰 NGOs & Watchdogs             | 10,000+ orgs globally        |
| 💰 Decentralized Social Media   | $35 Billion (2030 projected) |

We address the convergence of these markets with a single platform.
